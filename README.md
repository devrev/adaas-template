# Airdrop snap-in template

This GitHub repository provides a template with example code to implement an Airdrop snap-in,
which imports todo lists, todos and users from a fake example external system into DevRev.

## Usage

1. Press on the green "Use this template" button, then "Create a new repository"
2. Name the repository in the form `airdrop-<external-system-name>-snap-in`,
   e.g.`airdrop-github-snap-in` (otherwise you will have to edit the snap-in manifest and a few
   other files after cloning).
   If you plan to develop for multiple external systems, you can also use your company name
   instead of the external system name, e.g. `airdrop-company-snap-in`.
3. Create the repository

A new repository will be created, with some data already populated by the template, assuming you set
the name according to Step 2 above.

## Additional info

While developing the Airdrop snap-in, make sure to refer to the
[DevRev snap-in developer documentation](https://developer.devrev.ai/public/snapin-development) and
also specifically to the
[Airdrop-related sections](https://developer.devrev.ai/public/snapin-development/adaas/overview).
